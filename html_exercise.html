      <h2>Where I've been</h2>
      <p>I moved to Brighton when I was very young. I attended school in Boulder and lived there for 6 years. I now live in Denver!</p>
      <ul>
      <li>Brighton <span>&#38</span> </li>
      <li>Boulder <span>&#38</span> </li>
      <li>Denver <span>&#38</span> </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Where I want to go</h2>
    <p>I have visited Dublin before and I LOVE the city like its my home. I have had many friends speak highly of Austin, TX. Chicago is one of the great American cities everyone should see at least once in their life, even if their weather isn't my ideal cup of tea.</p>
